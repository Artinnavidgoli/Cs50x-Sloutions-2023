Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I was surprised that the time of the first three sets of simulations (10, 100, 1000), wans't so slow as I expected, they were quite similar.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The simulation become "good enough" around ten thousands simulations.
